# Huggingface Implementation of AV-HuBERT on the MuAViC Dataset

This repository contains a Huggingface implementation of the AV-HuBERT (Audio-Visual Hidden Unit BERT) model, specifically trained and tested on the MuAViC (Multilingual Audio-Visual Corpus) dataset. AV-HuBERT is a self-supervised model designed for audio-visual speech recognition, leveraging both audio and visual modalities to achieve robust performance, especially in noisy environments.
